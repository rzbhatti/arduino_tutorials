# L298N
The L298N is a dual H-Bridge motor driver which allows speed and direction control of two DC motors at the same time. The module can drive DC motors that have voltages between 5 and 35V, with a peak current up to 2A.

# Getting Started
In Arduino IDE `Tools` menu go to  `Manage Libraries...`. In the search bar search for `L298N` and install L298N by Andrea Lombardo. 

### Example L298N-Simple Or L298NX2-Simple
* From `File` -> `Sketchbook` -> `Libraries` -> `LN298N`, load  `L298N-Simple` Or `L298NX2-Simple`
* Connect the L298N with one or two motors as per the connections 
* Compile, load and run the program to UNO
